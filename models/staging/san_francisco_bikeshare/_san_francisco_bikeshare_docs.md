## BIKESHARE

San Francisco Ford GoBike , managed by Motivate, provides the Bay Areaâ€™s bike share system. Bike share is a convenient, healthy, affordable, and fun form of transportation. It involves a fleet of specially designed bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations. Bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system. People use bike share to commute to work or school, run errands, get to appointments, and more. The dataset contains trip data from 2013-2018, including start time, end time, start station, end station, and latitude/longitude for each station. See detailed metadata for historical and real-time data .
